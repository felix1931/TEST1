                  <h4>Our story</h4>
                  <p>Caruso’s Coffee has been roasting and blending specialty coffees in Northeast Ohio since 1982 and is highly regarded
                     within the industry as an expert in the field. We strive daily to ensure our customers receive the knowledge, 
                     training, and quality products necessary to succeed profitably in the competitive and growing world of specialty coffee and teas.
                      We also roast and blend a wide assortment of Fair Trade Organic Coffees. Our roasting facility is certified organic by OCIA 
                     Our roastery is also Kosher Certified by OK Kosher and we are SQF Level 2 certified. </p>

                      <div class="col">
                        <h4>Our coffee</h4>
                        <p>The recipe was originally the vision of two coffee nerds who were unsatisfied with the quality of the coffee in their neighborhood. 
                          What started as a pop-up coffee stall has transformed into a full cafe with seating for over 50 guests.

                          Our aim isn’t just to give people a place to meet and drink coffee, but to get people excited about the coffee they drink,
                           and where it comes from. Got more questions? Drop by and join us for a chat. </p>

                      <div class="col">
                        <h4>Our goal</h4>
                        <p>Couvee comes from the idea that everyone can enjoy coffee. It doesn’t matter if you like your coffee light and sweet, or you prefer strong coffee with no sugar, you can always enjoy it with your personal preferences in here. 
                          It’s our pleasure to help you find the best crafted drink that suits your taste in the best way. </p>
